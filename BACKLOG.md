# Backlog

## High Priority
1) Fix Firestore listen errors (400 Bad Request)
- Verify `projectId`, web app registration, and Firestore enablement
- Ensure correct Firestore rules (temporary open for dev)
- Confirm time filters query uses existing index; remove extra `orderBy` if needed
- Acceptance: Live mode streams without console errors

2) Add tooltip on map click
- On map click, find nearest point within radius, show popup with dB + time
- Acceptance: Clicking near a hotspot shows a small info popup

3) CSV/JSON export for current view
- Add button to export current `samples` to CSV and JSON
- Acceptance: File downloads with filtered data

4) Legend/Help modal
- Lightweight modal describing colors and what dB means
- Acceptance: Modal accessible and dismissible via keyboard/mouse

## Medium Priority
5) Time filters: 1h / 24h / 7d
- Firestore query range shortcuts + UI control
- Acceptance: Switching range updates data live

6) Device tagging support
- Extend schema to include `deviceId`
- Filter by device in UI (dropdown)
- Acceptance: Can filter map by deviceId

7) Improve intensity mapping UI controls
- Slider to tune min/max dB on the fly
- Acceptance: Changes reflect immediately on heatmap

8) Robust mock management
- Seed from static `mock.json`, toggle between generator and file
- Acceptance: Switching source updates heatmap without reload

## Low Priority
9) Performance tuning for 10k+ points
- Heatmap tiling/clustering or WebGL layer
- Acceptance: Smooth interaction at scale

10) Offline-first capture (web)
- Queue local samples and sync when online
- Acceptance: Samples persist after network loss and backfill later

11) CI/CD
- Lint/build on push, preview deploys
- Acceptance: PRs show status and preview URL

## Nice-to-have
12) Map theme switcher (light/dark basemap)
13) Screenshot/Share image of current map
14) PWA install with offline map tiles (partial)
